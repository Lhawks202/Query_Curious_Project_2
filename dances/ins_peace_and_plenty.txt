<code>
Al 1-4 End couples cast to the middle into right-hand turn with
       partner once around; middle couples move to ends.
   5-8 Couples in the middle two changes of rights and lefts
       (with hands, beginning with partner).
A2 1-4 New end couples cast to the middle into right-hand turn,
       with partner once around; middle couples move to ends.
    5-8 Couples in the middle two changes of rights and lefts.
           [Set is now turned halfway around. ]

B1 1-4 BACK-TO-BACK WITH A FLIP: With neighbor along the
       line, back-to-back about three-quarters, until left to left
       with neighbor and
       At the very last moment, turn left (toward neighbor)
       to face back the other way (now right to right with
       neighbor.)
   5-8 REVERSE BACK-TO-BACK: Fall back, come forward and
       pass by the left back to place.
B2 1-4 ALL LEAD AWAY: With the person you meet (partner at
       top and bottom, neighbor in the middle), lead away
       from the center, then turn and lead back into
   5-8 TWO HALF STARS: Middle couples, right hands across
       halfway, into left hands across halfway with end couples.</code>
NOTES\\
Al A2 3-4 This right hand turn once around is very quick.
81  This figure is a variation of Fried Herman's face-en-face figure. The difference 
being the “flip” of “turn around” is in the middle of the back-to-back
and leaves dancers side by-side \\
The timing in B1 usually requires a little emphasis. The flip around comes
on the last beat \\
B2 5-8 Make the two stars with movement and drive, flowing right into the next
round for the new end couples
A fairly energetic and exciting four couple dance. There must be drive
throughout, but also precision. ;
