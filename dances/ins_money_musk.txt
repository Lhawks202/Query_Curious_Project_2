Often, the dance is compressed into 24 bars (48 beats), by reducing each forward-and-back to four beats and/or by speeding up the allemandes. Some versions of this compression are given below.

The Money Musk tune has 4 parts, each of 8 bars; and each part is played just once through. For a 24-bar dance, the tune is shortened, usually by eliminating the fourth part. \\

The tune for Money Musk originated in Scotland in 1776 and the first dance instructions appeared in 1785. By 1792, the tune and dance had made it to North America, and both spread rapidly. (Many of today's dancers first encountered the phrase Money Musk when they were children, reading Little House in the Big Woods; it was a tune that Laura's Pa played on his fiddle.)

Archibald Grant was the 2nd Baronet of Monymusk, and after his expulsion from the
Commons in 1732 after the failure of some dubious speculation in mines with
the funds of the Charitable Corporation, he retired to Monymusk, where he
pioneered advanced farming methods and new crops such as clover. The
name means “noxious weed” in Gaelic.
