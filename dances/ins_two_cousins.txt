N.B.: If more progression is desirable, the men can cast one place at the
end of B1.

* One quarter siding: with partner start as in Cecil Sharp siding,
curving in to finish right shoulder to right shoulder with partner,
men facing in and women out. (Use four steps, close with right
foot on the fifth and pause on the sixth).\\
The dance is called after two characters in Shakespeare's “Much Ado
about Nothing”.
