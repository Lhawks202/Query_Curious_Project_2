 music by Mik Lammers\\
proper duple minor longways  with double progression
<code>   
   C1 long cast while C2 set and lead up
   C2 long cast while C1 set and lead up
   1st corners cross R shoulder
   2nd corners cross R shoulder
   3 changes of a circular hey starting with neighbour (without hands)
   (Now begin second progression)
   C1 half figure of 8 down with new C2, 
   who do a quick cross at the end.
   All set toward the centre of their 4
   then turn single right shoulder
   Circle L half way
   Partner 2H turn once round.</code>
