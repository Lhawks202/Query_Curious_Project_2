•The choreographers suggest a skip change step for the 1/2 figure 8s.

The tune and dance both came out of Gary Roodman’s Choreography Class at Mendocino English Week 2005.
Jonathan Jensen wrote the tune, specifically for the class to write a dance to, while walking in the redwood forest at Mendocino Woodlands State Park, on the way to the Big Tree. The class divided into groups, Jonathan Jensen and Earl Gaddis played, while each group wrote a dance to Jonathan’s tune.
