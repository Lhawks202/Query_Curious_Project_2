Panch (from the Sanskrit for “five”) was a beverage of Indian origin,
traditionally made from alcohol, water, sugar, lemon, and spice 
in English  rose rapidly in popularity after the 1660s. Celebrated in comic poems and songs
and lauded by wits, doctors, and politicians, it became closely associated with
the rising Whigs and the ascendancy of William and Mary (like the beverage
itself, welcome foreigners). It became the fashion to throw biscuits (sweet
or savory) called “toasts” into the mixture, hence the phrase to drink a toast
when commending the health of another, especially a beautiful woman, in
drink. \\

The punch bowl itself less the tubs we use now than a generous bowl
or large goblet quickly became a household necessity, a perfect wedding gift
or presentation piece for a valued employee; in some families, the generous bowl
did double duty as a baptismal font. \\

Inevitably, many coffeehouses served
a good strong punch, and many taverns were named “The Punch-Bow!” or
added the term to their signs, as a kind of Whig loyalty badge, hence “The
Crown and Punchbowl,” “The Red Lion and Punchbowl,” and many others.\\

The apotheosis of punch may be said to have come in 1694, when Edward 
Russell, then Lord of the Admiralty, gave a smashing party at Alicante in
Spain where, under a protective canopy, a fountain was made to run with
punch composed of four hogsheads of brandy, a pipe of Malaga wine, twenty
gallons of lime juice, twenty five hundred lemons, over half a ton of sugar,
five pounds of nutmeg, three hundred toasted biscuits, and eight hogsheads
of water, A small boy in a purpose-built little boat rowed around the fountain
to pour cups for the six thousand guests. \\

But perhaps we should leave the last
word to political philosopher Bernard Mandeville, from his Fable of the Bees of
1714: “I would compare the Body Politick to a Bowl of Punch: Experience
teaches us that the Ingredients judiciously mixt will make an excellent Liquor,
lik'd of and admir'd by Men of exquisite Palates” And so it is with all good
things, and with the dance named for that strong and sweet potation. (Refer-
ences: Chambers 496-7; Larwood and Hotten 88)
