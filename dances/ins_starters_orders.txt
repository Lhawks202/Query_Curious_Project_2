=======  STARTERS ORDERS ======
Dance and Music by Colin Hume.\\
Longways, couple facing couple: one very wide set.\\
Tune: STARTERS ORDERS
<code>
Al  Ballroom hold, galop across 8 steps, men passing back to back. Galop back, 
    ladies back to back.
A2  Lines 4 steps forward to meet; balance right and left. Do-si-do opposite 
    (swing if cold).
B: Right-hand star. Left-hand star.
C: Lines lead away 4 steps; balance right and left. Do-si-do partner (swing if still cold).</code>

At this point people complain that they haven't progressed. All you do is start again, dancing
with the couple diagonally to your left. The neutral couples (top couple on the men's side,
bottom couple on the ladies' side) join in the first galop across and then stay there.
Written for the Beckenham and Croydon Folk Dance Club on the occasion of a dance following a ramble
in the depths of winter. Something to warm the dancers up at the start of an evening, before there
are too many people for a single longways set.
