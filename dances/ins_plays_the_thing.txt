Teaching point:\\ The ‘open draw poussette” in A2 feels much like a circle except you have hands

Ashland Oregon is the home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. We have friends from the San
Francisco Bay Area and Seattle who come once or twice a year to see plays. We often have a
brunch and dance party at our house. Thanks to Sherry Kumler, Rosemary Murphree, and
Gregor Ure who tested this dance on one of those visits.
