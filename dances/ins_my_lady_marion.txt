Al  Lead up towards the presence. Face partner: singles right and left; 
    turn single to the right.

A2  In fours, right-hand star half-way. Join hands in lines: two singles forwards; 
    double backwards. :
Bl  Middle two men cross. Middle two ladies cross.

B2: Top couple meet; as they start to lead down the middle the others come up 
    the outside and follow them down.
The second and fourth time the dance is reversed, and starts with leading down the hall.

The fourth time through, instead of leading up a double, all lead up a single, step right and
honor the presence.</code>

Dedicated to Marion Wilson, who was very taken with the tune and persuaded me that I must write a dance to go with it. The style is that of a Basse Dance â€” a slow stately dance popular with the French and Italian nobility of the fifteenth century. A single is stepping forwards (or sideways or backwards) on one foot and then closing the feet together with a slight rise and fall. A double is three steps and a close. Many folk dance bands may not be able to play slow enough.
