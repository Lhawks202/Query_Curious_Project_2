The first Man cast down, and the 2d Wo. cast up at the same Time, then back again  
The first Wo. cast down, and the 2d Man up at the same Time; then back again  
The first Cu. lead up, and the 2d lead down at the same Time;
then the first and 2d Men lead to the Wall, and the We. lead to the Wall at the same Time;
then Hands all four quite and turn single and Right and Left half round </code>
