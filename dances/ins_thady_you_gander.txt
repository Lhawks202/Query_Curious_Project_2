Simple but popular country dance with its origin possibly in Ireland. The tune is Irish and known from at least the 1820s.\\
It seems to have been a popular folk dance collected from areas of Scotland in the early 20th C.
The ‘gander’ reference is derogatory, intimating Thady is of ‘loose character’, a flirt, and this is represented in the dance when the top lady beckons the men to follow her in a merry dance. The dance also includes a simple strip the willow finale. \\
(It was erroneously associated with ‘The Irish Trot’ of the turn of the 17th/18th century and recorded as danced at a wedding at the ‘Rocks’ in Sydney in 1803, but it is now known the Irish Trot is a totally different dance of triple minor progression as distinct from the simple more modern country dance progression of Thady.)
