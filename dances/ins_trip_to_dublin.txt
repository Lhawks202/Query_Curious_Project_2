<code>
Al 1-4 The first man, passing his partner by the right, goes CW
       a little more than half way round the second woman (sk.s.),
       and turns to his right so as to face the space between the 
       second and third women ; while the first woman goes
       CCW the same distance round the second man (sks.), and turns to
       her left so as to face the space between the second and third men ; 
       the first couple finish back to back, improper.
   5—8 The first man hands-three with the second and third women, CW, 
       while the first woman does the same with the other men, also CW (r.s.).
A2 1—4 The first woman, passing in front of her partner, goes CCW round the
       third woman and turns to her left, while the first man goes СЦ round the
       third man and turns to his right (sk.s.); they finish as before, 
       but on their proper sides.
   5—8 The men hands-three CW, while the women do the same (rs.); 
       the first couple finish in their original places.

Note 1. We consider the above variant more interesting.
The first couple lead up the middle to places and cast off one place (sk.s.) ; 
and turn each other once round (r.s.) (progressive).\\

Note 2.—To make the dance a three couples set - the first couple, while
executing the turn in the last four bars, should 
move down to the bottom place, the third couple meanwhile casting up one place.
