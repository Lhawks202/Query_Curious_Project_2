Note: In “siding” move no further than partner's side, keeping faces to each
other. In each figure all casts should be well rounded, so as to produce the "rose" effect.

The dance was produced as a grateful tribute to Miss Rose Sears, whose
delightful playing of the tunes has greatly added to the pleasure of trying
out the dances and making them known 1n Kent.
