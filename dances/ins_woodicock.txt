Lovelace Manuscript (about 1640) and published in Playford's English Dancing Master of 1651. It was interpreted by George Williams in 2021 using both sources (which are slightly different). It is a proper 3 couple longways dance in three parts, a USA dance (Playford says it is a dance for "as many as will", but dancers would need to sprint for a long set, and the middle dancers would get bored as they do very little).
