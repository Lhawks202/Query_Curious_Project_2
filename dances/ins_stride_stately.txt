NOTES\\

B 7-8 This “gate” person will be the same every time through the dance.\\
The critical moment in these heys comes when the women make their sharp
right turns to head to their “gate partner”.\\
Couples waiting out at the top and bottom should not cross over until the
very end of the dance, so that they will be available for the first “gating”
figure (B 7-8). Then they can “gate” with partner, do a simple two-hand
turn halfway, and begin the dance.\\
You can have everyone identify his/her continuing “first gate” person for
easy recognition later. To do this, after walking the A part (when everyone
is crossed over), have everyone look diagonally to his/her right two places
to acknowledge the person of the opposite sex. That's the person. In the
top duple set, 2nd man and 1st woman will have no one to look at. They
will have to individually fake the gate the first time. At the bottom, the same
is true for 1st man and 2nd woman.
