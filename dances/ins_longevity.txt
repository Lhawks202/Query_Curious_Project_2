Teaching tip: It is important to stress that dancers maintain eye contact in the "Two Cousins" siding, 
so that the direction of the circles will feel inevitable.

Note: In Wil van den Berg's dance "Two Cousins" (published in Dutch Crossing, 1993), she calls this 
"one-quarter siding" and describes it as follows: "With partner start as in Cecil Sharp siding, curving 
in to finish right shoulder to right shoulder with partner.... Use four steps, close with right foot on 
the fifth and pause on the sixth."

I wrote this dance for Lucy Weinstein when she celebrated the 21" anniversary 
of her 29'" birthday. The opening figure fits her style of dancing perfectly both 
graceful and flirtatious! Lucy is also an MD, so the title is both a birthday wish 
and a comment on her other life.
