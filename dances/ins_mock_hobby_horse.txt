This hobby-horse, in the later 17th century, was not quite yet the nursery
toy with which we are familiar today. As depicted in The Thames at Richmond,
the hobby-horse was the figure of a horse, generally a frame of fabric and
wood, fastened around the waist of a dancer, with rider's “legs” painted or
sewn on the sides, while the wearer's real legs passed through the skirt of
fabric. 
The hobby-horse’s performances were apt to be showy and athletic, and there
seems to have been a running joke such that the most memorable feature
the hobby-horse was that it was always forgotten.
