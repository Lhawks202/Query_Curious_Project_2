From the video, it appears the dance is a USA dance as follows:
<code>
U: Up a double and back 2 times.
Chorus: C2 cast R and go between end couples (M up, W down);
        All set in lines across, cross with person opposite;
        Set in new lines, then hands 6 until proper. 
S: siding R and then L
Chorus
A: Arm R and then L
Chorus
