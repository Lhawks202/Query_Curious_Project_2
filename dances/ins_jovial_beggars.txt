The Beggars CHORUS,
In the Jovial Crew. To an Excellent New Tune:

There was a jovial Beggar,
   He had a wooden Leg,
Lame from his Cradle,
   And forced for to Beg.
And a Begging we will go, we'll go,
   we'll go
And a Begging we will go.

Of all Occupations m
   A Beggar lives the best;
For when he is a weary
   He'll lie him down and rest:
And a Begging, etc.

I fear no Plots against me,
   But live in open Cell;
Why who wouâ€™d be a King,
   When a Beggar lives so well?
And a Begging we will go, we'll
   go, we'll go.
And Begging we will go.</code>
