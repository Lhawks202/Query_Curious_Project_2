Teaching Notes
While it is unusual for second corners to lead a figure before the first corners, and for left-focused figures to precede right-focused ones, the flow of the dance should make this feel natural in dancers' bodies. I often hear my first calling mentor, Erna-Lynne Bogue, urging dancers to quiet their minds and allow their bodies to dance as they already know how to do. I like that this dance communicates the same message even without words.
The texture change from A to B makes this dance more difficult than it appears at first glance. The briskness in A insists on strong connections with neighbor and partner, and the luxuriousness in B insists that dancers linger with their partner. I find mentioning this helps dancers enjoy the dance sooner.
