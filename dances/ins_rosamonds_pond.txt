**Rosamond’s Pond**, in the southwest corner of St. James’ Park, was created
to receive the waters of a small stream that once ran from Hyde Park. In the
mid-17th century, Charles II liked to feed his ducks and play with his dogs
there, to the great amusement of the public; later, it acquired a less benign
reputation as the favorite place for assignations between married women and
their lovers, as well as a prime temptation to would-be suicides, especially
those disappointed in love. The pond was filled in with earth in 1770.
