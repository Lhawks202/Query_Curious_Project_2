Orange girls sold fruits and confections at theatrical performances.  Orange Nan is listed among the common whores in the fourth and fifth issues of a short-lived periodical //The Wandering Whore//, 1660–1661.  Nell Gwynne, the actress who made her theatrical debut in Dryden's //The Indian Emperor// and who eventually became a mistress of Charles II, worked at the King's Theatre in Drury Lane as an orange girl.
