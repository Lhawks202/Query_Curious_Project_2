   1st and 3rd couples balance back, meet, take both hands and 
   slip through 2nd or 4th couples who slip up;
   all fall back and come forward a double; 
   R hands across in fours. Repeat, 2nd and 4th couples leading.
   Side; set and turn single. Repeat.
   Men cast to invert men's line; then women cast similarly; 
   set and turn single. Repeat, casting back up to places.
   Arm R; set and turn single. Arm L; set and turn single.
   Men fall back and come forward; men's hey. 
   Women fall back and come forward; women's hey.</code>
NOTES:
Part I, B1, 2 1-4
The "balance back" is small, so that the balance forward brings dancers close enough to join hands.
Part II B1, 2
Many choose a skipping step for the casts.
Another fairly straightforward U-S-A dance (up a double, siding, and arming). This bouncy, lively tune offers many opportunities for skipping.
