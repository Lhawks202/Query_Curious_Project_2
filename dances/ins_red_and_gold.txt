Written for the Beckenham and Croydon Folk Dance Club's New Year's Eve dance, when the theme for
the evening was "Red and Gold". The first section is "Red", symbolising fire, blood rushing
through veins, etc., and is danced with vigour. The second section is "Gold", symbolising regal
elegance, refinement, etc., and is done to a stately walk. That's the theory, anyway; they
weren't convinced at Beckenham either!

The music isn't as difficult as some of my tunes, though the musicians must be ready for the
change in tempo. There's an optional counter-melody, including a bar of "Nellie the Elephant"
which results from too long an association with Kafoozalum.
