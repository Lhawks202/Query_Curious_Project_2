==== Another interpretation ====

Note that this dance really is due to Bernard Bentley in [[https://colinhume.com/defalli.htm|Fallibroome 1]], published in 1962. Colin Hume (in https://colinhume.com/instr.htm#StMargaret) suggests a different interpretation for the instructions in the Dancing Master Volume 2, 1st Edition, c. 1713: John Young version, which has wording

//Note: The first strain once, and the last twice.

The first Cu. cast off both together, the Man falls in between the 3d Cu. and the Wo. falls in between the 2d Cu. then fall back, and hands half round  .   The 1st Man turns the 3d. Wo. and his Partner turns the 2d Man at the same Time, then turn your Partner half round, and lead her through the Bottom Cu. and come up and turn her, then the Wo. turns the 3d. Man, and her Partner turns the 2d. Wo. both at once, then turn Hands half round, and lead through the Upper Cu. and cast off and turn  :

Hume's instructions (reformatted) are
