The term "Sicilian Circle" has come to mean a way of dancing a minor set dance in a circle instead of longways. But once upon a time there was a dance called The Sicilian Circle (and before that, in 1822, it was called Circassian Circle). It appears to have taken its figures from The Plain Quadrille, but executes them in a duple minor format. See The Libary of Dance for more info. The dance was popular and evolved over the years. This is merely one version.
