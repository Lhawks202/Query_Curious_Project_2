Star Through is another movement borrowed from Western American square dancing. The man
does the movement with the lady facing him (in this case his partner). He puts his right
hand against her left hand, and the joined hands are raised as the two walk towards each
other. The lady turns to the left under the man's arm as he turns to the right, and they
end up side by side with the lady on the right. It's easier than it sounds!

Normally this sort of dance and tune would have a typically American name, but since 1 live in Bayswater rather than America I decided to be different.
