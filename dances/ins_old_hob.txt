William Chappell (1855) records that the words are by Thomas D'Urfey set to a tune that appeared first in a 1696 play written by Doggett called The Country Wake.
<code>
Of all the simple things we do,
To rub over a whimsical life;
There's no one folly is so true,
As that very bad bargain, a wife.
We're just like a mouse in a trap,
Or rat that is caught in a gin;
We start and fret, and try to escape,
And rue the sad hour we came in.</code>
