. AKA and see "Offa's Dyke." Oswestry, Shropshire, traditionally derives its name from "Oswald's Tree," a reference to Oswald of Northumbria who was defeated here by Penda of Mercia in 642, and who had the misfortune to be crucified on a tree. His family could not retrieve his remains for a year. A border town, Oswestry suffered from depredations by both the Welsh and English. 'Oswetry Square' is the name of an English Country Dance set to the tune of "Offa's Dyke."
