**SADLER’S WELLS**
The story of Sadler's Wells is, if anything, even more romantic. Richard Sadler, having discovered a former monastic spring on his property in Islington,
opened a “Musick House” and pleasure garden there, claiming that its iron-rich waters were effective in treating “dropsy, jaundice, scurvy, green sickness, and
other distempers to which females are liable — ulcers, fits of the mother, virgin's fever and hypochondriacal distemper.” After a brief spell as a fashionable resort
for its concerts and waters, however, it suffered such a decline that by 1711 it was called “a nursery of debauchery; and in 1724 its then-manager, James Miles,
‘was murdered. Sadler's Wells now enjoys happier days: the sixth theater on the site is now one of the world’s premier venues for dance performance.
