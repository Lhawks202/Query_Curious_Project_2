Teaching Points:\\
A2 bars 5-8: neighbors turn with R-hand on R-file and L-hand on L-file.\\
BI and B2 bars 5-8: the lead up or down for the 2s is not very farâ€”enough to come forward out
of line before beginning the cast.\\
Atend of B2, it works well for the 1s to curve over R-shoulder fo get to progressed places.\\
