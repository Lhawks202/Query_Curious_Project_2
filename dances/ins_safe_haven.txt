A1  1-4  1s set right and left, then two-hand turn partner halfway. 
    5-8  Circle four to the left once around. 
A2  1-4  2s set right and left, then two-hand turn partner halfway. 
    5-8  Circle four to the left once around. All home but crossed over.     
B1  1-4  Open ladies' chain halfway. (Women right-hand turn halfway, then turn partner 
         left hand once around. Men should cast left into the left-hand turn.) 
    5-8  Partners, keeping left hand joined, join right hands as well. With cmssed hands, 
         women draw their partner counterclockwise around the set halfway. (This is like 
         a draw poussette with cmssed hands. Women are where they started the chain 
         and have their partners on their left.) 
B2  1-4  Open men's chain halfway. (Couples should release left hands first; women can 
         use their right hands to guide the men into the chain before casting. Men left-hand 
         turn halfway, then turn neighbor right hand once around. Women should cast right 
         into the right-hand turn.) 
   5-8   With crossed hands, men draw neighbor clockwise around the set half~ay 
         to progressed places, opening to face into the set. (This is like a draw poussette 
         with crossed hands.)

n the days after September 11, 2001, many of us turned to the ECD list and our 
local dance communities for solace and comfort, This simple tune lodged itself in 
my brain and the dance followed quickly thereafter. Virtually all of the figures 
are supported and the dance is intended as a celebration of our solidarity. Bare 
Necessities included this tune on their recording New Shoots: New American 
Dances (Vol. 10).
