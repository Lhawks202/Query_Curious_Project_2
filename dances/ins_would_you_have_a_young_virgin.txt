Note:\\
Setting has been substituted for the original kissing. Those preferring actual contact 
may use clapping: together, R., together, L. But for those (not necessarily of 
purer intent) who desire to revert to the original, a rallentando is recommended 
at B 5-6.

London. J. Walsh, P.Randall, J.Hare, 1710/11

The dance is here under the title Shilly Shally all Folly but when it reappears 
(as the first of two alternative figures to the tune) in Walsh's Second Book of the
Complete Country Dancing Master, 1719, and in John Young's The Dancing Master: Vol.
the Second, all four editions, it is under the new title. A Virgin of 15 years 
in John & William Neal's Choice Collection, Dublin, 1726, is yet another 
figure to the tune.
