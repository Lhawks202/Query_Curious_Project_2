1st man sets towards 2nd woman, falls back; and turns her.
2nd man does the same to 1st woman.
1st corners cross, 2nd corners cross; 
1st couple half figure-8 through 2nd couple.
2nd couple half figure-8 through 1st couple; 
partners turn.</code>

(The title means 4 (old) pennies + 1/2 penny + 1/4 penny. In 1970 just before 
the currency changed this was slightly less than a US nickle, or slightly less 
than 2p in modern British currency. What its buying power was in 1709 I do not know) 
Apparently there was an old ballad where people negotiated sexual favors for 4Â¾d.
