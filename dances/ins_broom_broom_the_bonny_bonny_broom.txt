Part I
A1 1-4  Partners lead up a double and back.

   5-8  With top two couples facing up and bottom two couples facing down, end dancers, 
        followed by neighbors, cast through nearest middle place and lead back to original 
        places all ending facing down.

    5-8  Cast and lead to places as in Al.
   
 B1 1-8 1st and 3rd couples face each other, dance forward a double to meet and fall back, 
          then circle four once around.
          
 B2 1-8  2nd and 4th couples the same.

NOTES
Part I, A1
At the end of bar 4, the bottom two couples turn towards partners and face down to start 
the cast and lead in bar 5.

Part I, B1 and B2
As the 1st and 3rd couples (2nd and 4th couples in B2) meet, the couple in second place 
(third place in B2) must step back out of the way.

Part III
In this quiet dance, the last figure, in Part III, is known as "the burst"!
A calm dance more about control and timing than anything else. Fairly simple and easy 
to learn, it provides dancers the opportunity to dance precisely to the music. T
he signature is in the third part, where everyone leads away from the set, and 
returns just in time to start the circle. The timeless tune is known to folk music 
lovers everywhere.
