Portobelo in Panama was the principal Spanish conduit for Peruvian silver in
the Caribbean. Populous and bustling, it was highly coveted and was also the
site of a sixty-day annual fair. Despite the heavy fortifications the Spanish built
to defend it, Portobelo was frequently attacked by English pirates, includ-
ing the notorious Henry Morgan, as well as the British Navy. Edward Vernon
(1684-1757) scored a notable victory for England at Portobelo in 1739â€”
hence the naming of the Portobello Road in London, as well as the Portobello
section of Edinburgh-but the British never secured a foothold there. \\
the Spanish sought out less exposed routes and ports for the transport of their silver.
