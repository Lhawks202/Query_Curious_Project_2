NOTES
Al, 2
ln Maggot Pie, the turns single are noted as being to the right after right hands across, 
and to the left after left hands across. We have been doing them the other way!
B1, 2
There is no facing back in to the set by the pairs that cross on the diagonals. 
Simply continue forward into the loop around the standing dancer.

A pleasant and most uncomplicated dance! Middle couple in any round has the extra pleasure 
 dancing the entire A music, above, and then below. All to a sweet tune.
