The **rigaudon** (French: [ʁiɡodɔ̃, ʁiɡɔdɔ̃], Occitan: [riɣawˈðu]), anglicized as rigadon or rigadoon, is a French baroque dance with a lively duple metre. The music is similar to that of a bourrée, but the rigaudon is rhythmically simpler with regular phrases (eight measure phrases are most common). It originated as a sprightly 17th-century French folk dance for couples.\\
