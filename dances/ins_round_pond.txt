NOTE: In the second figure, the siding should be done the "old" way, as described by Cecil Sharp in the
Country Dance Book. The B music of this dance is a "round" both musically and dancewise. The movements
always occur in the same order viz, Right Hand Turn, Left Hand Turn and Lead Across and Cast Back to Place.
In the 1st Figure it is the 1st Couple who start, in the 2nd, it is the couple on their left. i.e. 2nd couple, who
begin and 3rd couple start in the 3rd Figure.

One of the fruits of Pat Shaw’s visit to the US in 1974 and his time at Pinewoods camp was a treasured collection of dances assembled eventually in two volumes, Among the Pines and Between Two Ponds. One of those ponds—Round Pond—is the inspiration for this delightful, lively, 3-couple dance in round formation.
