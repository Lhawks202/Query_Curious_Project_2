<code>
A1 1-4 Taking inside hand with partner, all go four slips diagonally
       right and four slips diagonally left to back to back
       with original opposite couple.
   5-8 With new opposite couple three changes of a circular hey
       opposites facing, finish facing original opposite couple but
       facing in the opposite direction to that in which you started.
A2 1-8 Repeat all that in this direction to finish home.

B1 1-4 Right hands across half way with original opposite couple,:
       left hand across half way with the next couple,
   5-8 With the third couple right hands across all the way round.
B2 1-4 With the second couple left hands across half way, with
       original opposite couple right hands across half way (all
       home). 
   5-8 Left hands across all the way with the co originally
       behind you (you met them in A2) and at the end pass
       original opposite left shoulders to face new couple (the
       “second couple”) for the next round of the dance.</code>
The hands across figure should be a continuous movement: use your
hands but don’t make them too obvious.
