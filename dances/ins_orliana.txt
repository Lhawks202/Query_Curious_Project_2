A1 1-4 	Middles turn  in to middle neighbour to face the walls, lead out
		and wheel halfway round to face  in as ends lead in partner,
		half two-hand opposite, and open out to face out.
		Lines are now across the room, neighbours facing on the line.

these same places. (progression 2413)
(and new ends lead in, new middles lead out, to continue).
