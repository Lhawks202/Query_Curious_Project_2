Elizabeth wrote this dance for Claude Epstein on the occasion of their
marriage on August 31, 1996. She explains that the pirouette figure was
inspired by Montmorancy (1755), a dance in English Dances for the Dutch
Court reconstructed by Chip Hendrickson. She says: "If you do not care to
pirouette, simply turn in place to follow your partner around flirtatiously.”
