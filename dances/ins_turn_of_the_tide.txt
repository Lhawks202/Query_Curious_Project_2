====== Turn of the Tide ======
(Ron Coxall)   improper duple, waltz time\\
Instructions suggest C2 improper (either should work fine), but I prefer C1 improper as more familiar to dancers. --- //[[nashjc]] 2019/04/14 19:57//\\

</code>

Alternative final 8 bars (J Nash. To avoid too wide a dance.)
     
<code>
      Turning poussette: Men push a two steps (1 bar), man moves 90 degrees left,
      (woman pivots on spot), woman moves 90 degrees left (man pivots). 
      (This is the progression, as positions now reversed). Men push two steps. 
      Couples turn two hands 1.5.
      However, if behind the music, or subject to dizziness, just turn half.

Ron writes that the turning poussette represents a boat swinging around on
its anchor at the turn of the tide. "I wanted to acknowledge the influence of
friends who are dedicated sailors,‚Äù he writes. "They have influenced my
dancing, my calling and my dance devising."
