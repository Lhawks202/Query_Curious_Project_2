Oswestry is a town in Shropshire. Kynaston lived in the vicinity of Oswestry, near the border with Wales.\\

Oswestry Wake was originally the celebration of the Feast of Dedication (Assumption of the Virgin Mary), the 15th of August. After more and more "irregularities and licentiouness" crept into individual parish church feast day celebrations, Henry VIII regulated them, declaring the same feast day for all churches, the first Sunday in October, along with the Saint's-day to which the church was dedicated.
