According to the General Evening Post of July 20, 1790, “His Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales took the long odds in favor of his horse Magpie, at the last
Newmarket meeting, by which he is said to have won upwards of 50001. His
Highness jocularly remarked, that the notes of his Magpie were much richer
than those of the Sky-lark or Bullfinch.” (References: General Evening Post,

Graham Christian points out the phrase "Long Odds" was already in common use in horse-racing in the late 18th century, denoting a slim chance of gambling success.
