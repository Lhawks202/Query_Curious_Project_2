Thomas Slaughter established his coffee house at 74-75 St Martins Lane in
1692, and after his death in 1740, his business was taken over by Humphrey
Bailey. It was known as “Old Slaughter’s” after a competitor set up a “New
Slaughter’s” on the same street in 1760. “Old Slaughter’s” was the favored
haunt of the artist William Hogarth (1697-1764), whose St Martins Lane
Academy had its beginnings, c. 1735, in the circle of like-minded friends who
met there.
