William Bates (fl. 1730-1790), with tune "COMICAL FELLOW"  won the coveted annual prize of the â€œNoblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club"  which had been founded in 1761 to encourage music-making among the genteel.
So well-known was this trifle that caricaturist Robert Dighton (1754--1812) depicted it as the song of choice in his merciless satire on the well-born amateurs of the Catch Club, fifteen years later. \\
