This dance is adapted at the caller's whim to suit the dancers' capabilities. 
For the expert and energetic - B2 is sometimes danced as a double 
strip-the-willow and lead back to top, or as Dickens describes in 
"A Christmas Carol" as a thread the needle movement.

It was often called the finishing dance as it was usually the last dance of an evening. During the course of the nineteenth century this dance evolved into the Virginia Reel.  It is a proper longways set "for as many as will", though the best number seems to be between 4 and 8 couples.
