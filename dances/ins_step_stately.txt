It is customary to conclude the dance with
repetition of the First Part.\\

When three couples only are dancing, the progressive movement
is that of an ordinary. Whole-set dance. When,
however, five, seven or nine couples are dancing, the
progressive movement is that of a triple MINOr-set
with this difference that the leading couples gain,
two places in each round instead of ome. In this
latter case, couples going up the dance should, be
careful to note at the beginning of each round go
which minor-set they belong and their place in that
set. This they can most easily do by carefully noting
the positions and movements of the leading couples,
It should be noted that the restriction with regard to
the number of the performers is operative in the
Third Part only.
