This dance has a nice flow if the dancers can get the circles and hand
change to line up with the music. The turn and go round neighbour/partner
is very natural and simple once the pattern is understood, but the instructions at 
first may seem confusing.  It may help to slow the music a few
percent to avoid the movements being rushed, but the dance is nonetheless
quite lively.  --- //[[nashjc]] 2016/12/05 14:15//

**The Tatler**  is the name of a London newspaper (published three days a week) that was first published in 1709 by Richard Steele, using the pen-name "Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire". The aim of the periodical was to print news and gossip that filtered through London's coffeehouses. It was a successful venture that lasted for two years before Steele moved on to other publishing projects, and it was imitated by others; Edinburgh had its Tatler, for example.
