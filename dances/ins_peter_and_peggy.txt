       back for 3 beats, ending in original places facing
       down the set.

       by the right once around, as women turn by the
       left once around (using “handy hands”).

       place, as second couple moves up the outside to
       first place.

       3, etc.)             All home

       steps on a side, with hands).

       and separates to go up one more place (these
       changes are quick).

       around and fall back into lines to begin again :
      (plenty of time). </code>

Teaching Point I:\\ It is good to have long lines for this double
progression dance.

Teaching Point 2:\\ Teaching is a little easier if there is an even
umber of couples in the major set, because then there is no
waiting out at the top or bottom. At the ends, couples just turn
around and come back in as the other species for the circle once
around. With an odd number of couples, there is always a couple
out at the bottom, which can make things a little confusing, (Of
course, the advantage of an odd number 1s that, after your
changeover, you will get to dance with all the couples skipped
previously.)

Teaching Point 3:\\ The double progression in this dance is rapid
and always requires a little practice. I usually have the 1's walk it,
as the 2's stand still; then the reverse. Then do both parts together 
several times through. I may also have couples reverse
roles and walk it again.
