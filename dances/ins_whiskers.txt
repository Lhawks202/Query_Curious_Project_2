The royal courts of Elizabeth I and James I bristled with beards; they
diminished somewhat in the following reigns, dwindling to tufts and pencil
moustachios. In 1680, however, Louis XIV of France shaved:

//There have been few men more vain than Louis XIV, perhaps as a compensation for
his total lack of any single quality worthy of admiration. He desired always to appear
young, and the mode in his time was a slavish imitation of this foolish fantasy of
perpetual youth. Hence when (at the age of forty-two) the king found some white
hairs in his shred of moustache, the offensive truth was erased.//

His nation took the hint and shaved as well, and the English, ever emulous
of the French, followed suit: the beard largely vanished in England until the
reign of Victoria. Aesthetics, however, could not gainsay nature, and men
were compelled to draw upon the good offices of a professional barber
(self-shaving was not common until the later 18th century for want of good
equipment). Only the wealthy could afford the time and expense of the
paid shave more often than every several days; hence, most men must have
sported the shadow of incipient whiskers (which in that day more often
signified the moustache than the chin beard) much of the time.
