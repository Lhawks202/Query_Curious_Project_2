A whirligig in this period, would have signified not a pinwheel, but a town top or parish top, a
large top of about eight inches, which young people would keep spinning in
cold weather as a form of diversion. John Fletcher, made the connection between the dance and the dizzying motion of the top:\\
  * A boy of twelve 
  * Should scourge him hither like a parish-top
  * And make him dance before you
