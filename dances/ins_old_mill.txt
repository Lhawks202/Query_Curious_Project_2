Three couple set, \\
John Walsh's 1718 collection
<code>
A1 1-6	1st man casts below 2nd man, right-hand turns 3rd woman once 
        and casts above 2nd woman to his partner's original place 
        while 1st woman balances back then follows her partner round 
        2nd man and overtakes him as he is turning 3rd woman, crossing 
        the set below 2nd couple, and (now followed by 1st man) casts 
        up around 2nd woman and crosses the set again into 1st man's 
        original position, where she turns about left to face him.
   7-8	1's left-hand turn half-way to original places.
A2	1st woman casts down, left-hand turns 3rd man and follows her 
        partner to his original place while 1st man balances back, follows her 
        and overtakes her as she turns 3rd man, then casts up to original place 
        where he turns about right to face her; 1's right-hand half-way to original places.
B1	Keeping right hands, 1's lead down the middle and (with man below woman) 
        face 2nd and 3rd woman; then without pause, both do a hey for three across 
        the room (1st man with 3's, 1st woman with 2's) starting as the 1's hey 
        between the women and then those women between their partners.  Finally 
        (after a complete hey) 1's right-hand turn three-quarters to finish 
        improper in middle places.
B2 1-4	1's (now in middle) cross right shoulders, cast up to the top proper, 
        face down, turn single down and away from each other and again face down
        with 2's and 3's facing up.
   5-8	1's lead down the middle to the bottom, the other couples coming up 
        the outside to follow; 1's cast up to the middle places above 2's who 
        remains at bottom, 3's finish in top places.  
        All are progressed.</code>
