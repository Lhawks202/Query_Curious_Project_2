**Valentine’s Day** customs, like many other folk and rural observances, had
been discouraged under the Commonwealth, and the new figure and title for
this cheery tune reflects their revival. In his observations on England in the
1680s, Maximilien Misson (1650-1722) said:\\
On the Eve of the 14th of Feb, St. Valentine's Day, a Time when all living Nature
inclines to couple, the young Folks in England, and Scotland too, by a very ancient
Custom, celebrate a little Festival that tends to the same end: An equal number of
Maids and Batchelors get together, each writes their true, or some feign’d Name
upon separate Billets: which they roll up, and draw by way of Lots, the Maids taking
the Mens Billets and the Men the Maids; so that each of the young Men lights upon a
Girl that he calls his Valentine, and each of the Girls upon a young Man which he calls
hers: By this Means each has two Valentines: but the Man sticks faster to the Valentine
that is fallen to him, than to the Valentine to whom he is fallen. Fortune having thus
divided the Company into so many Couples, the Valentines give Balls and Treats to the
Mistresses, wear their Billets several Days upon their Bosom’s or Sleeves, and this little
Sport often ends in Love.
