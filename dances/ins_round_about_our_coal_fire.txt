The title of the Bride dance had come into currency again,
with a very strong seasonal association, after the 1730s, following the appearance 
of Round About Our Coal Fire; or, Christmas Entertainments (C. 1730) by the
pseudonymous Tom Merryman. Here, it was nostalgically resonant of customs
already receding into England's past:
The Dancing and Singing of the Benchers in the great Inns of Court in Christmas, is
in some sort founded upon Interest, for they hold, as I am informed, some Privilege
by Dancing about the Fire in the middle of their Hall, and singing the Song of Round
about our Coal Fire, &c.

This time of Year being cold and frosty generally speaking, or when Jack-Frost commonly 
takes us by the Nose, the Diversions are within Doors, either in Exercise or bythe Fire-side.

Country-Dancing is one of the chief Exercises and Cupid always sits in the Corner of
the Room where these Diversions are transacting, and shoots Quivers full of Arrows at
the Dancers, and makes his own game of them.
