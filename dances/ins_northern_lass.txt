Not many dances were devised in the 1920s and 30s.  \\
 At least one "North Country Lass" refers to Betty Maddocks, the 'fair maid of Doncaster', who (according to The Strand Magazine, 1906, p. 220) was "a heroine of the seventeenth century, who, being much sought after, bargained that she would only wed the man who could tire her out in dancing. A hundred gallants made the attempt, only to retire, utterly wearied, before the terrific energy of the young lady, who, presumably, lived single ever after."
