This nice tune seems to be crying out for a good dance. However, the instructions
below either do not work or else need a seriously careful edit to indicate how to
make the figures fit the music. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifBdjYATlnw
for how things go wrong. As far as I know, the original instructions were taken
from the CD liner notes of //Dance and Danceability//. --- //[[nashjc]] 2017/11/25 16:00//


A second version (below) based on adaptation by the Ottawa
English Dance Club on Nov 24, 2017, gave plenty of smiles to the Assembly Players
version of the tune. 


<code>
A1   All face neighbour, set R & L & turn single, 
     then take inside hands with neighbour & cross with partner, 
     1 st Wo & 2nd Man making arch; 
A2   Repeat to place, 1 st Man & 2nd Wo making arch: 
B    1-6   Rh across & back with Lh, then 1st Co lead down (2),
           turn (2) and lead back to 2nd place, 2nd Co moving up, 
     7-8   Cross corners; Men cross Lsh, We cross Rsh, then repeat. 
           NB Men cross first each time.
