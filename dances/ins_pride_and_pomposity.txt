     C2 cross and move up if necessary.</code>
Reconstructed by JN and named from Pride and Prejudice 
movie 2005 version. This is clearly a conceit created to 
give enough time for dialogue, particularly in the 
extremely long down and back. However, it is a nice 
looking dance, even if very difficult to phrase comfortably. 
Comments on the DVD suggest it took over 5 hours to shoot, 
on top of rehearsal, and there was a lot of editing after. 
It is unfortunate that the film shows practically only the 
head and shoulders of the protagonists -- the rest of the 
dancers are hard to see -- indeed they are "deleted" for 
the last round of the dance!\\     

Note: There is a triple minor version by Philippe Callens 1990 for Moniek van Hylfe\\
