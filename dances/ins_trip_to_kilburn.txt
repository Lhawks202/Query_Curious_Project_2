Kilburn was the site of the Bell Tavern on the Kilburn
Road north of London, which had been established around 1600. In 1714,
ferruginous waters were discovered near the site, and very rapidly tea gardens
and a great room were set up to rival Sadler’s Wells; this dance capitalizes on
the site’s new fame.

An advertisement from July of 1773 promises that:\\
the waters are now in the utmost perfection; the gardens enlarged and greatly im-
proved... The whole is now open for the reception of the public, the great room being
particularly adapted to the use and amusement of the politest companies. Fit either for
music, dancing, or entertainments. ..A plentiful larder is always provided, together
with the best of wines and other liquors. Breakfasting and hot loaves.
