I wanted a straightforward dance for the title track of the Dampier's Round CD, but I failed completely, so a couple of years later I came up with the above which I hope is the final version.  Trevor Monson and Robert Moir still prefer the version below, because it's different from other dances, and of course I'm happy for people to call that if they prefer it.  I'm giving the above version the generic name “Spring Blossom”, or if you want to be specific you can call it “Late Spring Blossom”.
