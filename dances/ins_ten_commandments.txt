Tune: Ten Commandments
<code>
 4  set forward turn single back
 4  men change women change partner change
 4  circle left three quarters and fall back
 4  back to back once and a half
 4  circle left three quarters and fall back
 4  neighbor back to back once and a half</code>

Tune is "Bonny Sweet Robin" by Anthony Holborne, 1597. \\
It is designed to teach basic English country dance figures, but it makes a perfectly good dance in its own right.
