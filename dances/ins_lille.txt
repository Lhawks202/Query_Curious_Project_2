Note on the dance \\
The War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1713), and especially the part played in it by John
Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, was a rich and enduring source of inspiration for topical 
songs and dances, This dance was undoubtedly written to commemorate the capture at the
end of 1708, of the French fortress of Lille after a prolonged siege by the commanders of the
Grand Alliance, Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough. The Marlborough
connection is evident also in the dances Woodstock Park and Blenheim House.
