NOTES\\
Al, A2 5-8 Note the two-hand turn is once and a half, back to proper sides.\\
B1 5-8 This can be done to a skipping or skip-change step.

Another straightforward, easy dance. The music is happy and humorous.\\

George Fogg selected this pleasing dance from the Thompson 1773 Compleat
Collection; its accessibility and agreeable tune have made it a favorite for many
dancers and callers. An incoherent novella, The Midnight-Ramble: Or, the Adventures 
of Two Noble Females was published in 1754. 
There maybe a connection between the rather distasteful action of the novella, 
which concerns the efforts of two women, accompanied by
their milliner, to apprehend their husbands’ “intrigues,” and this lighthearted
dance and tune.
