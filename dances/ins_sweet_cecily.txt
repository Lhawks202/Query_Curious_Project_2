<code>   
A.l   Working diagonally left, along the set - forward a double, fall
      back, set to the same person and turn single to change places.
      Dancers with no diagonal couple facing at the end of the set do
      the set and turn single changing with partners.
A.2   Repeat the movements of A.l with the person directly opposite (all
      now have someone with whom to dance) to progressed places, one
      place round the set as in "Bucksaw Reel".
B.1   Side R shoulder with the person opposite. Side L shoulder with partner.
B.2   Arm right with "corner" (ie. person next to you on the other side
      to your partner), and arm left with partner.</code>

Note: the "corner" is always the same person
