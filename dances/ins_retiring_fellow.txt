A1 With neighbor, right hand turn once around, The
   women change places with each other by the right
   shoulder, then face neighbor (the person you just
   turned with) for a two-hand turn halfway, an end
   facing the other pair up or down the set. (Its nice
   for the women to maintain eye contact with neighbor
   as they Cross, )

A1 SIMILAR FIGURE FROM NEW PLACES; 
   With partner (who is up or down the get from you), right
   hand turn once around, Men change places with

MUSIC: “Mundesse”, which appears in the first edition of
Playford’s The English Dancing Master (1651).

Teaching Point: \\ In B1 and B2, it is good to urge dancers to leave
a little space in the middle as they do the siding, so that there is
room for middle people to do the turn singles away.
