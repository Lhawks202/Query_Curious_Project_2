Teaching Point 1: \\ Teach the orientation in B1 7-8 before 
teaching the dance, Have everyone change places with
partner and then with neighbor turn as a couple a quarter turn to
the R.

Teaching Point 2: \\ In B2 1-4, there is plenty of time to lead up or
down, turn around at the end of Measure 2, and lead back. Urge
dancers to use the full four bars of music.
