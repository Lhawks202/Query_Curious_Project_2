Part I.
Al 1—4 The dancers in each file take inside hands
       and go forward and back a double.
   5-8 The women go two changes of a circular hey,
       opposites passing by the right, while the
       men cast off to their left, round the
       corner places, into the middle places in
       two horizontal lines—i.e., lst man
       finishes between 2nd and 3rd women,
       facing up, and 2nd man between Ist and
       4th women, facing down (sk.s.).

A2 1—4 These horizontal lines, taking inside hands,
       meet and fall back a double.
   5—8 As in Al, the women reversing the direction
       of their hey, and the men continuing 
       round counter-clockwise into each others places (sk.s.).

B1 1—4 Each man turns the woman on his right
       once round with the right hand, so that
       the two men end shoulder in the centre
       of the set; all four raise right arms to  make arches.
   5-8 3rd and 4th women skip round clockwise
       under the two arches to places. On the
       last four beats the men release hands,
       turn to the right, and fall back into the
       middle places of two horizontal lines—
       i.e, Ist man between 2nd and 3rd women,
       and 2nd man between 1st and 4th women.

B2 1—4 As in Bl, each man again turning the
       woman on his right.
   5-8 1st and 2nd women skip round clockwise
       under the two arches to places, and on the
       1st four beats the men release hands,
       turn to the right, and fall into original places.

Part 11.
A1 1-4 The men side with the women on their right.
   5—8 A morris half-hey on each side, the women
       casting off and the men following the
       women on their left (sks). (NB—
       4th woman will pass in front of 2nd
       woman, and 3rd’ woman in front of 1st woman.)

A2 1-4 The men again side with the women on their right.
   5-8 As in Al, to places. (N.B—1st woman
       will now pass in front of 3rd, and 2nd in front of 4th.)

B1 1—2 1st man advances a double to 4th woman,
       while 2nd man does the same to 3rd woman.
   3—4 The men, giving both hands to those
       women, draw them back a double, until
       the two pairs stand side by side.
   5-8 The same pairs, facing away from each
       other and retaining inside hands, lead
       out a double (obliquely), turn, change
       hands, and lead back a double, while
       1st and 2nd women meet and fall back a
       double passing under the arches made
       by the others. All end in places.

B2 1—2 Ist man advances a double to 2nd woman,
       while 2nd man does the same to 1st woman.
   3—4 As in Bl. 
   5-8 As in Bl, the 3rd and 4th women now
       meeting and falling back a double under
       the arches made by the others. All end in places.

Part III.

       on their right.

       woman, while 2nd man does the same
       with 1st woman.

       while 2nd man does the same with 4th woman.
