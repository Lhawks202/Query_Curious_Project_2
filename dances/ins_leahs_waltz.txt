<code>

  B1 1-4  First couple dance down center, face partner, and
          set right and left.
     5-8  First couple dance up the center and cast to third
          place, 2nd and 3rd couples moving up one place in
          bars 7-8.
  B2 1-4  Bottom two couples right hands across.
     5-8  Top two couples left hands across.</code>

NOTES
B1 1-2
Do not go too far down the set here because, in the second half of the phrase (5-8), the 1st couple must not only dance back to the top of the set, but also cast all the way down to third place.
B1 5-8
To make this dance a triple minor longways, 1st couple casts to second (instead of third) place here, and only the 2nd couple moves up one place


A sweet, romantic waltz dance, simple in its step and pattern. The solo in B1 intensifies the sentiment by focusing on one couple, who are given the opportunity to exhibit their style. The secret here is to make the dance as smooth and flowing as possible. The liner notes mention the reason for the choice of tune.
Fried's precise wording of this dance follows.
