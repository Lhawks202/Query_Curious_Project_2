<code>
All set to partners and cross over turning single 3/2; 
repeat to places.
1st couple cross over, make a wide cast down (sk.s.); 
cross below 2nd couple, cast up to places and turn single.
1st corners cross, 2nd corners cross; hands-4 half way round, 
1st couple cast down while 2nd couple move up.

Note: The signature "Trip to Paris" crossing at the start of the dance is
often too dizzy-making for some dancers. If you need to, fake it!
