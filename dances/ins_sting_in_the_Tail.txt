====== Sting in the Tail ======
Devised by Colin Hume in 1992. \\
Two three couple sets stacked side by side, one set rotated so that the men are on the inside of the combined set.\\
Tune: Jacob Hall's Jig\\

<code>
A1  On the right diagonal, side right shoulder to right.  Set moving forwards; 
    turn single to place.
A2  On the left diagonal, side left shoulder to left.  Set moving forwards; 
    turn single to place.
B1  Face partner: reels of four across the set.
B2  Lead partner forward a double and back (inside hands, so that the 
    tops of the 3-couple sets are at opposite ends — the left-hand set 
    lead down and the right-hand set lead up).  Tops cast to middle place, 
    middles lead through them and wheel round to the left to finish at the 
    bottom of the other set, bottoms lead up to the top.</code>

“Sting in the tail”  comes from the wasp (yellow jacket) which literally has its sting in its tail, and is applied to an explanation where the problem is only mentioned right at the end.  In this dance the “sting in the tail” is the last four bars of the figure when there are three different things happening at once.

Suggestion: Walk the figure through once, then walk the progression through twice more from these new positions.  All promenade half-way round the set to original positions, and off you go.  You shouldn't need to walk the finale through.
