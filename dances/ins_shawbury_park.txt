<code>
   
  A1  C1 down between C2 (who move up in bars 1-2) & outside next 2nd couple
      (at bottom must imagine the ghost couple), then up middle above own 2s
      and cast to second place
  A2  C2 same pattern
  B1  Corners set R&L, then turn single, then 4 hands round to left
  B2  While C1 lead up change hands and lead down, C2 lead down and up
      (Does this mean some couples meet? Or should 2s go outside?)
      Then partners face for 3 changes of circular hey to progress.</code>
