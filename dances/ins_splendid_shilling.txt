When soldier got recruited - he received a SHILLING as a compensation.\\


Jane Maxwell, Duchess of Gordon (1748-1812), was known for her flagrant infidelities, her
missing finger, and her patronage of Robert Burns. One of the most striking
stories about her, however, concerned her technique for encouraging young
men, in 1793, to join her husband’s new regiment, the Gordon Highland-
ers. She hosted reels wearing a version of a military uniform and a large
black Highland bonnet; male attendees would receive the King's Shilling—the
payment that secured a soldier’s commitment to the Army—from between
her teeth, by kissing her—an unusually splendid shilling.
