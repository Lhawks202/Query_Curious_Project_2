Take not a woman's anger ill\\
Language:â€‚English \\
Take not a woman's anger ill,\\
But let this be your comfort still,\\
That if one won't, another will;\\
Though she that's foolish does deny,\\
She that is wiser will comply,\\
And if 'tis but a woman, what care I?\\

Then who'd be damn'd to swear untrue,\\
And sigh and weep, and whine and woo,\\
As all our supple coxcombs do?\\
All women love it, and though this\\
Does sullenly forbid the bliss,\\
Try but the next, you cannot miss.\\
