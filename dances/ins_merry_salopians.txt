Salop is the ancient name for the county of Shropshire,
Walsh republished the tune and track under the title “Women and
Wine”  As for Salopian merriment, it was
long believed that a certain Thomas Parr of Shropshire attained the age of
152 years (1483-1635). According to one local historian,

His long uninterrupted state of health was owing to the native vigour of his
constitution, improved by hardy and laborious exercise, by simplicity of diet, by
moderation in social enjoyments, and in no small degree to the pure and salubrious
air of the Welsh border of Salop. (Nightingale 265)
