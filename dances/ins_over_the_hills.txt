====== Over the Hills and Far Away ======

Beverly Francis did a dance somewhat like this at Rochester 2016 Ball
to the traditional tune. However, I take responsibility or blame for 
mis-remembering the figures below. --- //[[nashjc]] 2016/10/01 17:40//\\
Duple minor proper\\
There's plenty of time for each figure, so use up the music.\\

<code>
A1 1-8 Rights and Lefts - 4 changes. Slow.
