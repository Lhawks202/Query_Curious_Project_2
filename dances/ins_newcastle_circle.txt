   TEACHING POINTS 
   - need to take partners 1st – dance angels raise hands, beginners pick one
   - lady on man’s right, man on lady’s left
   - mood/attitude – let dance express your inner joy, there is beauty in
    moving in time to the music
   - single =  R, together; double = R,L, R together 
   - start walking forward with right-foot -L-R-together, then back
   -  Set R (small hop (spring lightly) on right foot, bring left to right, 
   - change weight briefly to left and then to the right) the Set L …
   OR easy way just hop R then L (unlike contra balance)
   - Turn Single – turn clockwise to your R in a small circle, 4 steps 
   - to get back to place
   - Turns - take R hand with partner chest height– demo handshake hold, 
   - elbows slightly bent, W formation, luxurious length, equal 
   tension 1-2 lbs (giving weight), body turned in direction of movement, 
   smile, eye contact, 
   once around back to place, don’t hold on too long! let go in time; 
   then Left turn back to place
   - back-to-back (dos-si-dos), face partner, pass by R shoulder, move 
   - sideways just enough to clear partner, fall back passing L shldr
   - 2-hand turn – chest height, elbows bent arms held wide, 
   body turned in direction of movement, equal tension, 
   let go just in time at end of figure</code>
