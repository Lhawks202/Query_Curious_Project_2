MAIDEN LANE
Common variant: Sharp's interpretation, hewing closely to the original, calls for dancers, in Part I, 
to move toward the men's wall, fall back, and then dance half
a hey. In Part Il, 1s would then make their diagonal progression back up the set. The widely danced 
variant chosen here allows each couple to lead the dance in
rapid succession. Some callers prefer a mirror hey in I: BI, B2. 

The origin of the name of
this street in Covent Garden is unclear, but it seems to date from the 1630s
and may pertain to the ladies of the court of Charles I and Henrietta Maria
(Henrietta Street abutted it on the north side); it was later the location of
the Bedford Head Coffee House and the Cider Cellars tavern. Voltaire, in his
1726-28 sojourn in London, lodged at the White Peruke on Maiden Lane.
