MUSIC: “Twenty-Something” by Jonathan Jensen.  
Teaching Point: \\ It helps at the outset to make it clear who W2 is.
Also, in B(5-6), point out to the dancers that there is distinct 
music for making the circle. Experienced dancers, who have been
conditioned to 8-bar “chunks,” may have a tendency to rush
through this bit of the dance.
