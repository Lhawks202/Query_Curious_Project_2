In 1705, Queen Anne granted the lands around
Old Woodstock Castle, a former royal residence, to Sir John Churchill,
the 1st Duke of Marlborough, the dazzling victor in so many campaigns 
in the War of the Spanish Succession: Ramillies, Blenheim, Lille,
Oudenaarde, Malplaquet (many of these, like much of the conduct of
the war and much of Marlborough’s career, commemorated in dances)
in expression of the thanks of a grateful nation. \\
This stupefyingly grand
building was to be built at public expense, but delays and cost overruns 
and unseemly personal and political squabbles at Court stopped
all Crown monies and work at Blenheim in 1712, at which point the
Marlboroughs went into self-imposed exile. Marlborough’s star shone
again with the accession of George I, but he had little time to enjoy
the house: Marlborough died in 1719, leaving his Duchess to fund and
supervise the completion of the work in the mid-1730s.
