Teaching tips: In A2, it's important not to get ahead of the music. Each change is two waltz steps 
and it helps to have the dancers notice their straight lines after each pass.

I composed this dance for Jacqueline Schwab and Edmund Robinson on the 
occasion of their marriage. The biblical title comes from the Sermon on the Mount 
(Matthew 5;13); it seemed to me an apt reference to people who make their 
surroundings worth savoring, but also to Edmund's role as a Unitarian minister. 
Childgrove included this tune on their 2008 recording Wanderlust.
