Teaching points:\\
L-wall dancers means those dancers on the L-file side of the room. R-wall dancers means those
dancers on the R-file side of the room (see glossary on page 47).

If you want to trade who gets to be in the middle, you can use the turn single in B bars 3-4 as a
way for the middle person to trade places with one of the other dancers in line.
