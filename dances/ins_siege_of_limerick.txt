commemorating the two assaults by William of Orange on the Jacobite
stronghold of Limerick in 1690 and 1691

By then, it was late August. Winter was approaching, 
and William wanted to finish the war in Ireland so 
that he could return to the Netherlands and get 
on with the main business of the War of the Grand 
Alliance against the French. For that reason, he 
decided on an all-out assault on Limerick.
William's men had suffered about 3,000 casualties, 
including many of their best Dutch, Danish, German 
and Huguenot troops. The Jacobites had lost only 
400 men in the battle. The worsening weather made 
William call off the siege and put his troops into 
winter quarters, where another 2,000 of them died 
of disease. William himself left Ireland shortly 
afterwards and returned to London.
