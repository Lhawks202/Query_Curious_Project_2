====== Pilgarlic ======

Interpreted by Audrey Towne from “204 Country Dances,” circa 1751\\
Longways for 3 couples: AAB x 3\\
Tune: Pilgarlic\\
<code>
Al 1-4 1M cast (2M moving up) and set to 3W;
   5-8 IM turn 3W by two hands, ending in 2M's place.
A2 1-4 1W cast (2W moving up) and set to 3M;
   5-8 IW turn 3M by two hands, ending in 2W's place.
B 1-8 1s and 3s right hands across, left hands back;
  9-16 1s and 2s four changes of a hey, with 1s moving to the foot
       of the set at the end of the phrase.
Repeat twice more to original places.</code>

Audrey notes that she added the setting in Al and A2 and the left hand star
in the B music to the original instructions. She adds: “Pilgarlick’ is an archaic
word meaning ‘bald-headed man.’ It is a corruption of the word ‘peeled
garlic."

According to the Phronistery (a dictionary of obscure words) a pilgarlick is a “poor wretch; self-pitying person," although it could also refer to a bald-headed man (from the supposed resemblance between a bald head and peeled garlic -- "pilled garlic," in British dialect. The verb "pill" comes in part from the Old English pilian--"to peel").
