There are numerous tunes named "The Tempest", but any 32 bar tune will do.

The original dance was a popular European dance called "La Tempête". When it came to England some people translated it to "The Tempest"; others appear to have thought they heard "Tom Pate" and named the dance so! Hugh Rippon went one step further and, after devising a dance in the same formation in 1972, named his new dance "Fred Pate" after Tom Pate's brother!

The earliest reference that I have found is 1802. As was common in those days, if a tune or concept was popular then many sequences of moves were set to it. Here are examples of many different Tempests in the Four Facing Four Formation:
