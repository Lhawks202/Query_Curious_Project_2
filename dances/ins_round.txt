<code>
   1st couple swings down middle into 2nd place (sk.s.)  
         while 2nd couple casts up; 
   2nd couple swings down while 1st couple casts up.
   In lines up and down the hall, 
      all go 4 slips to L and 4 slips to R; partners arm R;
   All fall back a double, forward to places; turn single, 
   1st couple slips down while 2nd couple slips up outside.
   Circular hey 4 changes, partners facing; partners arm R.
