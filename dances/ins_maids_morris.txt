+Sharp did not specify the direction of the turns single, but right shoulder was standard at the time. Dancers now may prefer: circle left, turn single left; circle right, turn single right.

Graham Christian (2015) spurns the modern-era notion that morris dancing was a strictly male occupation. He cites numerous historical examples of women morris dancing, beginning with Will Kemp's morris dance from London to Norwich in the year 1600, when after he left his position of principal clown in the troupe The Chamberlain's Men (see "annotation:Kemp's Jig" for more). He was joined by women morris dancers twice during the journey.
