       the second man by the left (sks). (The third couple start the hey by casting wp.)

       his own side, passing the second man by the left, while his partner does the
       same on her side, passing the second woman by the right (sk.s.).
Bl 1—4 The first couple lead down the middle through the third couple and cast up 
       into second place (sk.s.), the second couple moving up on the last four beats.

       bottom place (sk.s.), the third couple moving up into second place on 
       the last four beats.

Note.—The dance may be made a longways for as many as will, if, in B2, bars 1—4, 
the first couple cast only one place.\\        
Both the Apted book and The Playford Ball has entirely different B1&2 (involving leads, casts and 2hs) and the movie P&P has a different B2 involving setting and crossing.
