There are several videos of this dance on the Lambertsville ECD Video list.
**All** of them show how challenging the timing in this dance is for dancers.
Despite the languid tune, dancers must move VERY briskly. And there is really
no time to catch up. An **unforgiving** dance, but a very nice one if all the
dancers can handle to pace. --- //[[nashjc]] 2019/04/14 16:02//
