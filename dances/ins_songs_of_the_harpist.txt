During the heys, the first couple touches each other's hand in passing
through the middle, at the beginning and halfway through the phrase.

The tune now popularly known as Carolanâ€™s Welcome was played it in honor of the Pope's first visit to Ireland in 1979, an event from which the tune got its new name.
