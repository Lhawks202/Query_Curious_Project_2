There are many videos for this dance on the Lambertsville ECD video list,
but this one shows how precise set alignment avoids jerky and frantic
dancing. This dance is one of the OED favourites. Hard to believe it
is over 300 years old now.

Longways duple minor

<code>
A1   1-4     1st and 2nd single file circle L (2 doubles - half way round)
     5-8     Turn to centre and meet, then turn out single left ,
             Clapping once on 2nd beat of bar 8
A2   1-4     1st and 2nd single file circle R (2 doubles - half way round)
     5-8     Turn to centre and meet, then turn out single right,
             Clapping once on 2nd beat of bar 8
B1   1-4     1st couple short cast down, 2nds leading up
             Partners set R & L
     5-8     Partners facing, rights and lefts, 2 changes with hands,
             finishing close, improper.
B2   1-4     Partners fall back 2 setting steps, then cross over passing
             right shoulders, then turn right (loop) to face in original
             places
     5-8     1st couple, RH turn moving down into 2nd place as 2nd couple
             cast up into 1st place.

Note: As in the video, I prefer, as a couple 2, to avoid the "cross, face 
and cast" in part B2. Rather I prefer to cross and keep going, curving up 
in a wide cast into place. The instructions do not require one to face and cast, 
which incurs a rather dizzying twirl.  --- //[[nashjc]] 2019/04/14 17:05//
