The Princes de Gavre, Charles- Emmanuel-Joseph (1695- 1773) and thereafter his son, Francois Joseph Rasse de Gavre (1731- 1797), were governors of the province of Namur (one of the three regions of Belgium); both held high offices
and places of trust and esteem in the court of the Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine (1712-1780), and this dance might have been dedicated to either father or son.
