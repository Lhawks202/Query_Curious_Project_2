The back-to-back moves in parts A1 and A2 are, for this dance, traditionally
performed so that the dancing couple pass R shoulders forward, then retire
until they have just passed their left shoulders (and could look each other
in the eye), then they both turn single R to place. Will practice, this can
be very stylish.

The Savage family history is peppered with noteworthy and notorious—women
including Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers, who flung a box with her
treasured pearls into a pond to keep them from angry Parliamentarian rioters,\\
as well as Anne Gerard, mistress of the 4th Earl Rivers and probable mother of
the poet Richard Savage. 

By far the likeliest Mistress Savage circa 1710, however, is Elizabeth Savage, 
daughter of that same 4th Earl Rivers, who eloped
with James Barry, 4th Earl Barrymore in 1706.\\ 
Despite the couples efforts, Elizabeth Savage’s father never forgave her;
when he died in 1712, he excluded her from his will. Barrymore successfully
contended for the recovery of part of her inheritance; she herself died in 1714

**The signature movements of the dance**, with its fickle gestures toward three
different dancers in quick succession, must have seemed an apt illustration
of the fibs and false promises of elopement and secret marriage, and must
have come to seem prophetic of Barrymore's career, as he, after Elizabeth's
death, went on to be viewed as one of the most double-dealing politicians in
England: only his advanced age spared him from trial and probable execution in 1745, 
after the failure of Charles Edward Stuart's attempt to seize the
English Crown.
