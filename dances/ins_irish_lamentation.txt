The tune is at least a generation older than the dance, and its provenance is still contested; it is known as â€œLament for Limerick",
and plausible tradition attributes it to Myles O'Reilly (b. 1636) and assigns it to 1691-2, in the wake of the loss of Limerick, under Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan
to the English army of William III.\\
