<code>
1  Partners face. The man takes his partner's left hand in his
   right and they change places, the man making a quarter turn
   to the right and the woman, who passes under the joined
   arms, making a quarter turn to the left. Don't let go hands,
2-3 Dip and dive with your own opposite couple and the next
    couple you meet. First couples dive first.
4   Partners California twirl*.
5-7 Circle left once round with couple just passed. Face this
    couple.
    
8 All pass opposites right shoulder and face original opposites.
  Everyone is progressed, but now the second couple is facing
  clockwise. This is position A.

9 First woman and first man cross diagonally (woman in front)
  to the places of the opposite couple who pass on the outside
  along the circle. All face new opposites (same sex).

10-11 Turn this opposite once round, men with the left hand in the
      outer circle, women with the right hand in the inner circle.
      Finish facing original opposites.

12 Second woman and second man now cross diagonally to the
   places of the opposite couple who pass on the outside along
   the circle. All face new opposites.

13-16 Repeat bars 9-12 in the opposite direction, the men will now
      turn left hand in the inner circle, the women right hand in the
      outer circle. Finish facing original opposites - position A.

17-20 The two men turn right hand once round and then go
      clockwise around the women into each other place while the
      women go counterclockwise half way around the men and
      then turn each other left hand once round, (It is important for
      those turning in the middle to keep the turn tight and to ease
      out* in time to allow the next pair to turn) 

21-24 Repeat bars 17-20 in same direction and all finish in
      Position A but with backs turned to partner.
25-26 Lead out original opposite (inside hands), turn away from each
      other and, paying good attention to new neighbor, come back
      to partner.

In bars 9-32, there is a more or less continuous movement with no full
stops.\\
* California twirl: partners, having inside hands join change
places and direction, the woman passing under the joined arms
and making a half turn to the left, the man making a half turn to
the right (around the woman).\\
* Ease out: a small movement to connect the next figure with the
figure just done in the easiest way.
