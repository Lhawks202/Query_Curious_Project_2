Printed broadsides call the tune
“The Shepherds Delight.” The ballad, in at least twenty-three stanzas, tells of
a maiden who, after being deflowered and abandoned by a knight known as
Sweet William, demands her rights from the King, William, reluctant in the
extreme to marry any “shepherds Daughter,” tries to send her away with a bag
of gold, but:
  * O Ile have none of your gold she said
  * Nor Ile have none of your fee.
  * But I must have your fair body,
 
  * Once they have been married, she reveals that her rank far surpasses his:
  * But when they came unto the place,
  * Where Marriage rights were done,
  * She provd herself a Dukes daughter,
  * And he but a Squires Son.
