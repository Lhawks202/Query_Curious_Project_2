====== ROW WELL YE MARINERS ======

Longways for as many as will 1650
<code>

A 1—4 All lead up a double and fall back a double to places (r.s.).
  5—8 That again.
B Bar 1 First man faces up and moves two slips to his left.
  Bar 2 First woman faces up and moves two slips to her right.
  Bar 8 First man slips back to his place.
  Bar 4 First woman slips back to her place.
C 1—4 First man and first woman face each other,
      fall back a double, and move forward a
      double to places (r.s.)-
D Barl First man and first woman clap hands on the
       first beat of the bar, and strike their right
       hands together on the middle beat,
  Bar 2 Same again, striking left hands together.
  Bar 3 First man claps hands on the first beat of the
        bar, and strikes his chest with both hands
        on the middle beat; while the first woman does the same.
  Bar 4 First man and first woman strike both their
        hands together (right on left and left on
        right) on the first beat of the bar.
  5—8  All that again, striking left hands first.

Second Part.
(Duple minor-set.)
A 1—4 First and second men side; while first and
      second women do the same (r.s.).
  5—8 First and second men go a single to the right
      and honour, and then change places, pass-
      ing by the left; while first and second
      women do the same (progressive).
B 1—4 Agin First Part, first and second men doing as
      the first man did, first and second women
      as the first woman did.
C 1—4 All four fall back a double and move forward
      a double to places (r.s.).
D 1—8 Both couples do as first man and first woman
      did in First Part.</code>
It will probably be found more effective to omit
the First Part altogether.
