**Ragg:** made of or designating a sturdy yarn made up of multiple light and dark, esp. cream and gray, strands producing a flecked pattern

The title, meaning, just as one would expect, a scrap of cloth, implies the sort of trifle, whim, fancy, or maggot that enlivened the repertoire of dancers and musicians of the
period.
