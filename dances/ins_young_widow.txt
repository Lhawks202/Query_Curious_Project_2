[[young_widow| Old instructions file]] (Triple minor version)


Before Queen Victoria made her dear Albert's death the occasion for a
lifetime of sour seclusion, the widow was a provocative and alluring figure. In
the 17th and 18th centuries, the widow often enjoyed a better legal status than
a mere daughter or wife. She might well have control over her late husbandâ€™s
money; she could be a woman of enterprise, taking over her husband's business. 
Still more dangerously, to the prurient (and misogynist) imagination of
the time, she had been offered a taste of carnal satisfaction but been denied its
daily bread.
