According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the year 501 a Saxon named Port landed at the area of Hampshire later known as Portsmouth with his two sons and killed a young British nobleman. The first docks were established in Portsmouth in 1194 by Richard I. The French burned them in 1369, but it was Henry VII who developed a dockyard there in 1496 from which Portsmouthâ€™s growth began.
