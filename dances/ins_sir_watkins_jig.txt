====== Sir Watkin's Jig ======


Three couple longways, G Major, 6/8\\
A Choice Collection of 200 Favourite Country Dances (Thompson), 1774. Retreads (Bolton), 1985.

<code>
  A1 1-4   1st couple long cast to second place (2nd couple
           moving up on bars 3-4).
     5-8   1st couple two-hand turn.
  A2 1-8   1st and 3rd couples four changes of rights and
           lefts, starting with partner.
  B1 1-4   1st couple lead down through 3rd couple and cast
           back to second place.
     5-8   1st couple lead up through 2nd couple and cast to
           sec- ond place.
     9-10  1st couple turn single down (man right, woman
           left).
  B2 1-4   Circle six left halfway, breaking into two lines.
     5-6   Keeping hands, lines set, moving backwards.
     7-8   Letting go hands, turn single moving forward.
     9-10  Partners two-hand turn halfway.</code>

NOTES\\
A2  The four changes here are leisurely (four steps per change). They should be not only elegant, but also timed to the music.\\
B2 5-10 This is a slightly quicker sequence compared to the rest of the dance. One suggestion is to set back in a line, and not too far. Then attempt to do the turn single forward together! Finally, be on time with the short halfway turn.
