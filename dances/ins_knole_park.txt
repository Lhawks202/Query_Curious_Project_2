Note: Knole Park is near Sevenoaks Kent.  The name Knole, a place-name in Kent, is an Anglo-Saxon one, meaning knoll or hillock, while the estate of Knole Park was the home of the Dukes of Dorset. Knole is said to be the largest private house in England and is set in a deer park, enclosed in 1406. Knole Park is one of the few Tudor deer parks in England to have survived, and the only one in Kent.
