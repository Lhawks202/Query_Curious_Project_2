The Virginia Reel was the most popular dance amongst the Mormon pioneers who came across the plains to Utah\\
Dance found in Wilson, 1816, and there is no definitive description. This is, as best I can recall, the dance I grew up with. It is a proper longways set "for as many as will", though the best number seems to be between 4 and 8 couples. This video shows a 5 couple set.
