====== Rain on the Roof ======

Duple minor, Chris Sacket 2009

The official version is apparently a proper dance, but approximately
half the videos of this dance are danced as improper duple minor dances.
The instructions are built from videos, so may not correspond to the
original choreography.

Restart.
