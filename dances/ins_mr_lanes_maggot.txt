Notes: A2 is confusing as written in that it separates all the pieces by couple.

Another view of A2: \\ 
1st 4 bars are egg-beaters for C1 and C3 at the bottom.(C1 cast while C3 lead, then C3 cast while C1 lead).
last 4 bars of A2:  C1 don't stop, but keep going in lead to top and cast to 2nd place, while C2 (at top) cast to bottom, C3 follow C1 to top.
