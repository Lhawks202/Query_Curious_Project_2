(This Swedish video chosen because it shows the geometry pattern of
the dance, though the dancers are rather wooden and trying to dance
on stone pavers that are slippery!)\\

This dance was possibly used by the P&P director for the dance between Mr Collins and Lizzy as it gives Mr Collins a very good opportunity to go wrong.... but recover. The Apted editors change the dance to a 3 couple dance, with an additional B music to repeat the "chase" and progress the couples.

Notes:\\
In the BBC series, Elizabeth danced with Mr Collins, and had to give him dance instructions.
They performed a different version of the Al and A2 music.
